<p>In the war-ravaged world of Escape from Tarkov, cultists are a mysterious and formidable
   adversary that players must learn to hunt effectively. These enigmatic factions, known for their
    eerie rituals and devout loyalty to their dark beliefs, roam the streets and forests of Tarkov,
    posing a significant threat to scavengers and PMC operatives  alike. To successfully hunt cultists,
     it is essential to approach with caution, for they are often armed with deadly close-quarters 
     weapons and demonstrate an uncanny ability to blend into their surroundings. Employing stealth, 
     well-placed shots, wether it be alone or with your squadmates is key to taking down these 
     fanatical foes and securing their valuable loot. This page will show you how to do just that,
     by providing an in depth guide on different strategies, weapons, angles and more to not only
     take out the mysterious cult, but also adapt to the dangerous situations you might 
     find yourself in.

  <h3>Basic information on cultists loadouts</h3>
 <p>Cultists prefer to dwell in the dark of the night. They can be found between the hours of 22:00 and 7:00 in varying group sizes on locations:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Factory</li>
  <li>Customs</li>
  <li>Shoreline</li>
  <li>Woods</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The Cult of tarkov features its own distinctive classes, 
  those being the Priest, leaders within the cult who are strong 
  and tricky foes, deploying their undelings to fight in their steed. and 
  the Warrior devoted followers of the priest who are very aggressive 
  when provoked. While the two differ in class, their relevant loadouts remain
   relatively similar (excluding healthpools) as seen below.</p>
