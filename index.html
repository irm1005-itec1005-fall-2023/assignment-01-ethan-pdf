<p>In the war-ravaged world of Escape from Tarkov, cultists are a mysterious and formidable
   adversary that players must learn to hunt effectively. These enigmatic factions, known for their
    eerie rituals and devout loyalty to their dark beliefs, roam the streets and forests of Tarkov,
    posing a significant threat to scavengers and PMC operatives  alike. To successfully hunt cultists,
     it is essential to approach with caution, for they are often armed with deadly close-quarters 
     weapons and demonstrate an uncanny ability to blend into their surroundings. Employing stealth, 
     well-placed shots, wether it be alone or with your squadmates is key to taking down these 
     fanatical foes and securing their valuable loot. This page will show you how to do just that,
     by providing an in depth guide on different strategies, weapons, angles and more to not only
     take out the mysterious cult, but also adapt to the dangerous situations you might 
     find yourself in.

  <h2>Knowing your enemey</h2>
  <h3>Basic information on cultists class, loot, and loadouts</h3>
 <p>Cultists prefer to dwell in the dark of the night. They can be found between the hours of 22:00 and 7:00 in varying group sizes on locations:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Factory</li>
  <li>Customs</li>
  <li>Shoreline</li>
  <li>Woods</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The Cult of tarkov features its own distinctive classes, 
  those being the Priest, leaders within the cult who are strong 
  and tricky foes, deploying their underlings to fight in their steed. and 
  the Warriors devoted followers of the priest who are very aggressive 
  when provoked. While the two differ in class, their relevant loadouts remain
   relatively similar. below are cultists healthpools and some highly sought after gear
  worth picking up.</p>

  <h2>Recommended loadouts</h2>
  <h3>Loadouts for cultists engagement</h3>
  <p>now that we are more familiar with the scale of the threat, its much easier to workshop a loadout that fits the appropriate playstlyle. 
    there is all kinds of gear up for grabs on the market of tarkov, being able to identify what will help you for the right price is a cruicial
     part of tarkovs gameplay loop and is something all players should be familiar with if theyre even considering taking on such a formidable foe.
    </p>

  <h4>Ammunition</h4>
  <p>Ammo is going to be the most important part of taking on the culstist. Having the right caliber to not only pierce their armor, but also guarantee headshot eliminations is very crucial as these enemies have more health than the average foe in tarkov. In terms of fighting against cultists, typically you want to have 7.62 or greater, because of its armor penetration, velocity and base flesh damage. Listed below are some cost efficient options that yield consistent results:
 </p>
<table>
<thead>
  <th>7.62x39mm</th>
  <th>7.62x51mm</th>
  <th>9x39mm</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
  <td><img src="images/Ammo/7.62x39BP.webp" alt="BP"></td>
  <td>
    <img src="images/Ammo/m61.webp" alt="m61">
    <img src="images/Ammo/M62ICON.webp" alt="M62">
    <img src="images/Ammo/m80.webp" alt="m80">
  </td>
  <td><img src="images/Ammo/sppgs.webp" alt="sppgs"></td>
</tr>


</tbody>
</table>
    <p>
      Some other high caliber rounds are effective but are 
      not cost efficient, so use them at your own discretion.
    </p>

   <h4>Weapons</h4>

   <p>
    Being fitted with the right firearm most definitely has an impact on efficiency 
    when it comes to hunting cultists. Weapons with both single and automatic firing 
    settings are ideal, as they provide you with stability for close quarters and ranged
     combat and enables the user to adapt to the warriors rapidly changing behaviour. 
     however some single fire options are still optimal due to the high muzzle velocity. 
     The most cost efficient weapons are <strong>NATO</strong> firearms, so they cost 
     <strong>USD</strong> or have inflated prices 
     on the market but are reliable weapons bottomline.

  <h4>Tactical Devices</h4>

  <p>
    When working at night, having the right technology that gives you an edge in the 
    darkness can be very beneficial. Night vision, Ir laser pointers and searchlights, 
    and even functional modifications such as holographic scopes can make taking down 
    your target a walk in the park. However, it's important to keep in mind that it can 
    get costly very quickly, especially in terms of night vision, it is strongly recommended 
    not to use anything else other than the GPNVG-18 because of its wide field of view and 
    image quality, everything while cheaper does not provide the benefits seen in these nods.
  </p>

  <h4>Armor</h4>
  <p>
    survival is paramount, and venturing into the night to hunt down cultists requires careful 
    consideration of every aspect of your gear. Selecting the right armor is a pivotal decision, 
    as it can mean the difference between life and death at the height of an intense firefight. 
    Cultists are cunning adversaries, and your choice of armor will determine your ability to 
    withstand their relentless attacks, from their high-power ammo and well-placed shots. 
    Given the scarcity of high-level armor, there will be a focus on more accessible 
    lower-tier gear.Whether you prioritize mobility, protection, or a balance of both, 
    your selection will define your strategy. Listed below are some recommendations 
    for each weight class and coverage.
  </p>
  <h4>backpack</h4>
  <p>
    Probably the most straightforward aspect of prepping your gear. Cultists have a chance
     of spawning with high-tier level 5-6 armor. Highly sought after so you want to be able 
     to carry it out once the firefight is concluded. Having a large backpack adds weight to 
     your character but at night your chances of running into further combat are unlikely however 
     this does not mean it is impossible. The amount of profit and gear you receive after a 
     successful hunt is something you want to fully indulge in so here are some recommended 
     examples of large affordable backpacks to make the most of the loot.

<section id="behaviours">
<h2>Cultist Combat</h2>
<h3>Ai behaviours and engagement tactics</h3>
<h4>behaviour</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cultists are highly known for their stealth. 
  They tend to hide in off angles, foliage, and areas with high coverage, and attack when you least expect it. 
  They can be fairly spread at most times, this way they can cover a wider area, this however can delay their rotations 
  to different points. When scanning an area they will always be either prone or crouched in cover. They are cold-blooded, 
  which means they will not appear on thermal radars, and their footsteps are completely silent. The only audio queues they 
  give are rummaging through foliage, faint whispers, or tiny grunts when injured. When approached by a player, 1 or 2 warriors 
  will coordinate a stealth attack using a knife to inflict intoxication, it will 
  then retreat back to its post. If aimed at for too long, they will retaliate with suppressed gunfire. If a warrior is
   fired upon, the injured cultist will return fire, and the priest will retreat. whereas if a priest is fired upon, all 
   cultists will converge on the player's location from all directions in an attempt to take them out, they will also 
   throw grenades to force a rotation.
  </p>

  <img src="images/Help_I'm_scared.JPG.webp" alt="attacking cultist">

  <h4>rules of engagement</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>When engaging with cultists, it's very important to take things slow. Analyze the area and look for a 
      sealable area with as little as 2 entrances. This is important as once the cultists are agitated they 
      will try to push you from multiple locations, so minimizing the amount of places they can push you from 
      will make it much easier to take them on.
    </li>
    <li>
      Never push, always let them come to you. They tend to act very slow but it's better to take them on one
       to two at a time. Being able to confirm your kill will allow you to keep track of how many might be left.
    </li>
    <li>
      Never hold a wide angle. When cultists are in an aggressive state 
      they like to switch up their hiding spots and peek around cover. If too much 
      of your body is exposed at a time. And if they see you before you see them it will 9 times out 
      of 10 lead to a swift death. This also allows you to get easy headshots while taking fire.
    </li>
    <li>
      If approached by enemy PMCs, always fight them before fighting the cultists, as juggling both
       will make it much harder to keep track of everything that is happening.
      </li>
  </ol>
